# FunctionLib

A set of tools I made public that
are probably used in every game, I 
just save time for the people who don't want to rewrite everything.

## Installation

In your `wally.toml` put:

```toml
    "FunctionLib" = "isophes/functionlib@0.1.0"
```

## Documentation

There's no documentation site up at the moment, I will work on it in the future when FunctionLib has a few more functions.

## Contributing
